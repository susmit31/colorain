# Colorain
Ever wondered how people make those console programmes print in pretty colours? Well, the answer is simple: there are colour codes with which you have to tag up the text. The problem is, the codes are pretty complicated, and so typically people write bland, all-whites console programmes. Colorain is a package that makes printing coloured text to the console a piece of cake. Using a simple markup designed just for colouring text on the terminal, Colorain allows you to quickly add colours to any Python project you might have. There's a few other packages that help you to print colourful text with Python, but none with the ease of use as Colorain.

## Installation
```
pip install colorain
```

## Usage
```python
from colorain import *
# parses the colour tags and colour-codes the text as needed
txt = ColoredText('`f|y`Okay`f|n`, workin `f|c`fine`f|n`') 

# prints the coloured text
print(txt) 

# strips off the colour tags and gives the raw text
print(txt.raw_text()) 

# we've overloaded the plus operator for you
# so that you can manipulate your strings just
# as usual
print(txt + FGRed("\nOr is it?") + "\n*VSauce background intensifies*")
```
